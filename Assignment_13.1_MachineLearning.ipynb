It involves the creation of algorithms that enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, learning from experience, and making decisions.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Example: An example of machine learning is email spam filtering. Instead of manually programming rules to identify spam emails, machine learning algorithms can be trained on a dataset of emails, with labels indicating whether each email is spam or not. The algorithm learns patterns from this data and can then classify new incoming emails as spam or not spam based on what it has learned.\n",

    "# Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained on large datasets of images to recognize objects or patterns within images. For instance, a deep learning model trained on a dataset of cat images can learn to identify cats in new images by detecting patterns such as shapes, colors, and textures associated with cats."

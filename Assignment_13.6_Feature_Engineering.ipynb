    "# Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding is a type of encoding where categorical variables are assigned integers based on their order or rank. For example, if you have a variable representing education levels (e.g., High School, Bachelor's, Master's, PhD), you might assign 1 for High School, 2 for Bachelor's, 3 for Master's, and 4 for PhD.\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label encoding is a simple technique where each unique value in a categorical variable is replaced by a numerical label. For instance, in the case of binary categories like \"Male\" and \"Female,\" you might encode \"Male\" as 0 and \"Female\" as 1.\n",
    "Example of when to choose one over the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has an inherent order or ranking, such as education level or economic status. Label encoding, on the other hand, is more suitable when there is no ordinal relationship among the categories, such as in the case of color categories like \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue.\""

    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categorical variables are encoded based on the target variable. It assigns ordinal ranks to categories based on the mean of the target variable within each category.\n",
    "Example: In a binary classification problem, if you have a categorical variable representing different cities, you can encode them based on the mean target variable (e.g., conversion rate) for each city. Cities with higher conversion rates might get higher ranks.\n",
    "When to use it:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you suspect that the categorical variable has a relationship with the target variable and you want to capture that relationship in the encoding."

    "# Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It indicates how much two variables change together. If the covariance is positive, it means that the variables tend to increase or decrease together. If it's negative, it means that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis as it helps in understanding the relationship between variables. For example, in finance, covariance is used to understand the relationship between the returns of different assets in a portfolio.\n",
    "Covariance between two variables X and Y is calculated as the average of the product of the differences of each variable from their respective means."

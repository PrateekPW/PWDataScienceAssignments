    "## Ans> Abstraction:\n",
    "## Definition: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on real-world entities and representing their essential characteristics. It involves focusing on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "## Example: Consider a Vehicle class. The abstraction of a Vehicle may include essential characteristics like start(), stop(), and drive(). The users of the Vehicle class don't need to know the internal workings of these methods; they only interact with the high-level functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation:\n",
    "## Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. It involves restricting access to some of the object's components and only exposing what is necessary.\n",
    "## Example: Continuing with the Vehicle example, encapsulation would involve making the attributes (like engineType, fuelLevel) private, and providing public methods like start(), stop(), and getFuelLevel() to access or modify the state. This way, the internal details of how fuel level is managed are encapsulated within the class."
